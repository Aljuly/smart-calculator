## General info

This service allows User proceed basic long arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, integer division, division with period finding. When User selects any particular operation, short operation description is appeared.     

For the non-authenticated users only addition operation is allowed. For the other operations one should register first.
  
## Features

To make a calculation one need to pass operation Id, first operand, second operand. The result will be JSON structure representing calculation result and calculation chain. Also request should contain security token.
There is such Operation Ids stored in database:
* 10000 - addition
* 10001 - subtraction
* 10002 - multiplication
* 10003 - integer division
* 10004 - division with period finding)

To get security token User have to authenticate or register. There is JWT authentication is used.
For request caching Redis is used. When User makes calculation request, its saves in Redis store along with response. Search in Redis store is providing when making every new request. If such a request found, response to User is taking from Redis.
